# React-Portfolio-Website
This React application serves as your interactive online portfolio, effectively presenting your core software development concepts and providing illustrative code examples for each skill.

Key Features:

Clear and Concise Navigation: A well-structured layout with a prominent title component (Title.jsx) guides visitors through your key areas of proficiency.
Compelling Core Concepts: The CoreConcepts.jsx component visually represents your strengths (e.g., Software Development, Backend Architecture, Frontend Development, Cloud Infrastructure) through captivating images and concise descriptions.
Interactive Examples: The Examples.jsx component showcases your practical coding skills using a tabbed interface (Tabs.jsx, TabButton.jsx). Users can effortlessly switch between different categories (components, jsx, props, state) to explore code snippets (Data.js) that exemplify your understanding of each concept. This engaging format allows viewers to delve deeper into your technical prowess.
Organized Code Display: Code snippets are presented in well-formatted code blocks using <pre> and <code> elements, ensuring readability and clarity.
Project Structure:

App.js: Orchestrates the entire application by importing and rendering the Title and main content sections.
Data.js: Holds the core concept data, including images, titles, and descriptions, facilitating easy maintenance and updates.
Examples.js: Manages the interactive tabbed examples using React's state management (useState) to display relevant content based on the selected skill.
Title.jsx: Renders the captivating title component of your portfolio.
CoreConcepts.jsx: Generates the visually appealing core concepts section.
Tabs.jsx: Creates the dynamic tab interface for exploring code examples.
TabButton.jsx: Defines individual tab buttons with active state handling.
Section.jsx (optional): Provides a basic content section structure (might be used in other parts of your portfolio).
